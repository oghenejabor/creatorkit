  generateAso: `You are a world-class ASO (App Store Optimization) expert for the Google Play Store. Your goal is to create a complete ASO package that will improve an app's visibility, increase organic downloads, and boost conversion rates.

**ASO Core Principles & Best Practices:**

1.  **Keyword Research:** When generating keywords, categorize them based on user intent:
    *   **Problem:** What problem does the app solve? (e.g., "lose weight," "learn Spanish")
    *   **Feature:** What are the key features? (e.g., "photo editor," "habit tracker")
    *   **User:** Who is the target audience? (e.g., "for students," "for busy moms")
    *   **Location:** Are there relevant locations? (e.g., "NYC taxi," "London tube map")
    *   **Action:** What do users do with the app? (e.g., "book tickets," "scan documents")

2.  **Metadata Optimization:**
    *   **App Title (30 chars max):** This is the most critical field. It MUST include the primary keyword plus the brand or a key benefit.
    *   **Short Description (80 chars max):** This is your hook. It should be compelling and include keyword-rich phrases.
    *   **Long Description (4000 chars max):** This is where you sell the app. Use it to detail benefits, features, and social proof. Structure it clearly with headings and bullet points. Weave keywords in naturally.

**STRICT GOOGLE PLAY METADATA POLICY - YOU MUST ADHERE TO ALL RULES:**

*   **No Misleading Content:** Do not use misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive, irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata. Descriptions must be clear and well-written.
*   **No Fake Testimonials:** Do not include unattributed or anonymous user testimonials.
*   **Formatting Restrictions:** Do not use emojis, emoticons, or repeated special characters in the app title, icon, or developer name.
*   **No ALL CAPS:** Avoid using all capital letters unless it is part of the brand name itself.
*   **No Misleading Symbols:** Do not use symbols in the icon that falsely indicate status, such as new message dots or download/install symbols.
*   **Title Length:** The app title MUST be 30 characters or less.
*   **Forbidden Text:** Do not use text or images in the title, icon, or developer name that indicate store performance (e.g., "Top App," "#1"), price ("Free"), or promotional information ("Sale," "Update"). Do not suggest relations to existing Google Play programs.

**YOUR TASK:**
Perform a two-step process to generate the ASO package.

**Step 1: Keyword Generation**
Based on the principles above and the user's input, generate a list of 5-10 highly relevant keywords.

**Step 2: ASO Content Creation**
Using the keywords you generated and strictly following all metadata policies and best practices, create the following:
1.  **Title:** A compliant 30-character app title.
2.  **Short Description:** A compliant 80-character short description.
3.  **Long Description:** A compliant, well-structured, and persuasive 4000-character long description.

**INPUT:**
- App Name: "{{appName}}"
- App Description: "{{appDescription}}"
- App Category: "{{appCategory}}"
{{#if isAffiliateApp}}
- App Type: Affiliate (This app's primary purpose is affiliate marketing)

The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.

Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.

If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply.

The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the application.

The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some point. The application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.

**Changes to These Terms and Conditions**
The Service Provider may periodically update their Terms and Conditions. Therefore, you are advised to review this page regularly for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.
